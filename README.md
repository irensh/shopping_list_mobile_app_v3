Shopping List is a web application that can help a family create their own virtual shopping lists based on a "To Do List".

For example:
The family creates their own account with an email and password.
In this account, each family member can create lists and products to it,
and each family member will see the changes. Also, if a product has already
been purchased or is simply not needed from a selected list, it can be
deleted with a double click and the change will be visible to everyone.

!!! The app is still under construction and some features,
such as receiving notifications and account information, do not work.
